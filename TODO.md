# TODO

  - ([#23](https://github.com/rivermont/spidy/issues/23)) Better documentation:
    - In `docs.md`, many functions and variables simply have "TODO" as their description. These need filling out.
    - More inline comments is not bad either.
  - ([#29](https://github.com/rivermont/spidy/issues/29)) Multiple HTTP threads at once, using [mutexes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3310049/proper-use-of-mutexes-in-python) to corrdinate lists.
  - ([#31](https://github.com/rivermont/spidy/issues/31)) Working GUI - the remnants of our efforts can be found in `gui.py`

  - ([#30](https://github.com/rivermont/spidy/issues/30)) Respecting of `robots.txt`, with a disable option
  - PyPI/pip/apt?
